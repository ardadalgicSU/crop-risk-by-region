# crop-risk-by-region
Crop Risk by Area is a reproducible repo for crop risk–return analytics across regions. Using historical price, yield and weather, it fits classical time-series (SARIMA/ETS) and quantile models, then runs Monte Carlo to estimate E(π), VaR/CVaR and downside odds. Outputs: forecasts, risk reports and cross-area comparisons.
